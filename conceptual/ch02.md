Chapter 2 - Statistical Learning

---

1. For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally expect
the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse
than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.



2. Explain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem, and
indicate whether we are most interested in inference or pre- diction. Finally,
provide $n$ and $p$.

3. We now revisit the bias-variance decomposition.

4. You will now think of some real-life applications for statistical learning
(we only present one per question).

5. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a very flexible (versus a less
flexible) approach for regression or classification? Under what circumstances
might a more flexible approach be preferred to a less flexible approach? When
might a less flexible approach be preferred?

6. Describe the differences between a parametric and a non-parametric
statistical learning approach. What are the advantages of a parametric
approach to regression or classification (as opposed to a non-parametric
approach)? What are its disadvantages?

7. The table below provides a training data set containing six observations,
three predictors, and one qualitative response variable. Suppose we wish to use
this data set to make a prediction for Y when $X_1 = X_2 = X_3 = 0$ using
_K_-nearest
neighbors.
